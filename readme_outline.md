## Purpose and Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to explore whether there is a connection between country demographics, economic status, and military expenditures with terrorism in the last century. The completed analysis will be located on GitHub Pages and will contain interactive visualizations of the data including a map and web-scraped articles.

The reason this topic was selected was because it would enable us to work with large datasets full of information about many countries. Using these large datasets pertaining to country information and terrorism would allow us to use many techniques we learned throughout the course to transform the data as well as the flexibility to answer as many questions as possible. We thought that the topic itself was interesting to look into and we wanted to make sure that the datasets would not be too limiting in case there was unexpected technical difficulty in answering certain questions listed in the next section.
