# Segment 3

## Database Management:

Since this segment did not require deliverables for database management, I turned my attention to other deliverables.

## [Presenation](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment%203%20presentation%20drafts/final_presentation_v2.pptx):
* I expanded on the rough draft presenation that was created last week.
* The new format and structure provides an outline of the final presenation.  It provides an idea of what material is needed in order to complete the final presenation.  For example, I need to add images to the Database Manament section and finalize the language to that section.
* For ease of use, I am working on the presenation in Microsoft PowerPoint.  The completed version will submitted in the Google Slides format requested by the module.  However, there is a rough draft version on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E_kpYPFL0a_KAIhd9gufZIozvmDTO1Q2R3JtpMvM-yI/edit?usp=sharing) as well.  
* I also created a ["style guide"](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment%203%20presentation%20drafts/dashboard_style_guide.pptx) as a companion to the presentation.  The "style guide" will be used in developing the dashboard so that there is a visual harmony between the presenation and the dashboard.  This will provide a nice effect since we are demonstrating our dashboard during our in-class presentation.

## Dashboard Work:
### Plots:
* In addition the above, I have worked on creating plots from our [databases](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment_3_DB_charts/charts_terror.ipynb).  The goal is to provide our team with many resources so that we can edit our choices for the final dashboard and include the best representations of data.  

Examples are pictured below.

### Sortable Table:
* First, I [re-cut the terror_df](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment_3_load_terror_table/terror_data_table_mod.ipynb) to include the null fields, which I previously dropped, to whether that data should be included in the sortable table.

* Next, I reformatted the code used for the module 11 to create an [app file](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment_3_load_terror_table/static/js/app.js) for our dasboard. 

* The [HTML](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment_3_load_terror_table/index.html) from module 11 was similarly repurposed.  Another teammate is creating the skeleton of the dashboard, so I only changed HTML code where it concerns the new table so that she can copy it and paste it into the completed skeleton.

Example of the updated HTML code.
