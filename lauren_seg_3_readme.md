# Segment 3

## Database Management:

Since this segment did not require deliverables for database management, other deliverables are discussed here.

## Presentation:
* I expanded upon the rough draft presentation created last week.
* The new format and structure provides an outline of the final presentation and indicates where we need to add material for the presentation to be complete.  It will continue to be refined this week, prior to the final class.
* For ease of use, the working draft is constructed in [PowerPoint](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment%203%20presentation%20drafts/final_presentation_v2.pptx).  The completed version will be submitted in the Google Slides format requested by the Module.  The current rough draft version is on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E_kpYPFL0a_KAIhd9gufZIozvmDTO1Q2R3JtpMvM-yI/edit?usp=sharing) as well.  
* I also created a ["style guide"](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment%203%20presentation%20drafts/dashboard_style_guide.pptx) as a companion to the presentation.  The "style guide" assists in developing the dashboard so that there is a visual harmony between the presentation and the dashboard.  This will provide a nice effect since we are demonstrating our dashboard during our in-class presentation.

## Dashboard Work:
### Plots:
* In addition the above, I have created plots from our [databases](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment_3_DB_charts/charts_terror.ipynb).  The goal is to provide our team with many resources so that we can edit our choices for the final dashboard to include only the best representations of data.  

Examples are pictured below.

### Sortable Table:
* First, I [re-cut the terror_df](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment_3_load_terror_table/terror_data_table_mod.ipynb) to include the null fields, which I previously dropped, to determine whether that data should be included in the sortable table.

* Next, I reformatted the code used for the Module 11 to create an [app file](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment_3_load_terror_table/static/js/app.js) for our dashboard. 

* The [HTML](https://github.com/namin1993/Capstone_Project/blob/sement_3_lauren/segment_3_load_terror_table/index.html) from Module 11 was similarly repurposed.  Another teammate is creating the skeleton of the dashboard, so I only changed HTML code where it concerns the new table so that she can copy it and paste it into the completed skeleton.

Examples of the updated HTML code are pictured below.  The Module 11 code is on the left and the new code on the right.
